how to add your local project into github's repository?

this respository if not exist, you should create it first. Or you can add your prlject into your current repository.

assuming the url of this repository:
https://github.com/xxx/xxxx

cd to your folder containing your project:
git init
this command will create a file named '.git'; 

then:
git add .
this command adding all files in this folder into a staging area kind of like a caching area;

then:
git commit -m "***"

then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/xxx/xxxx

then:
git push -u origin master
the parameter '-u' is representing upStream, it is must create this upStream and this upStream is only requested at the first time when you push the code;
